IRS Valuation Methodology
========================

Section 1: Basic Valuation Principles
-------------------------------------

1.1 Interest Rate Swap (IRS) valuation follows the discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology. The present value is calculated by discounting all future cash flows using the appropriate discount curve.

1.2 For fixed legs, cash flows are determined by the fixed rate and day count convention. The accrual period is calculated using the specified day count convention (ACT/360, ACT/365, etc.).

1.3 For floating legs, cash flows are projected using forward rates from the yield curve. The floating rate is reset at each payment date based on the reference rate.

Section 2: Day Count Conventions
-------------------------------

2.1 ACT/360 is the standard day count convention for USD swaps. This means actual days divided by 360.

2.2 ACT/365 is used for EUR swaps and other European currencies.

2.3 The Modified Following business day convention is applied to adjust payment dates that fall on weekends or holidays.

Section 3: Risk Management
-------------------------

3.1 Sensitivity analysis is required for all valuation runs. Parallel curve bumps of Â±1bp must be calculated to assess interest rate risk.

3.2 The results should show reasonable symmetry and sign consistency. PV01 (Present Value of 1 basis point) should be calculated and validated against market expectations.

3.3 Curve twist analysis is required for trades with maturities greater than 5 years. Short-end and long-end bumps should be applied separately to assess curve risk.

Section 4: XVA Adjustments
--------------------------

4.1 Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) represents the cost of counterparty credit risk. It is calculated as the expected loss from counterparty default, discounted to present value.

4.2 Debit Value Adjustment (DVA) represents the benefit from our own credit risk. It is calculated similarly to CVA but using our own credit curve and negative exposures.

4.3 Funding Value Adjustment (FVA) represents the cost of funding risk. It is calculated as the expected funding cost over the life of the trade.

Section 5: IFRS-13 Compliance
---------------------------

5.1 IFRS-13 requires fair value hierarchy classification. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets.

5.2 Level 2 inputs are observable market data other than quoted prices.

5.3 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs requiring significant judgment.

5.4 Day-1 P&L checks are required for all new trades. The initial profit or loss must be within acceptable tolerance of market quotes.

Section 6: Reporting Requirements
-------------------------------

6.1 All valuation results must be exported to Excel with the following mandatory sheets: Cover, Instrument_Summary, Data_Sources, Curves, Cashflows, Results, Sensitivities, IFRS13_Assessment, Assumptions_Judgements, and Audit_Log.

6.2 Each sheet must contain relevant data with proper lineage tracking.

6.3 The audit log must include calculation timestamps, data sources, and model parameters used.
